This builds a program called specialproducts.

It takes a sequence of numbers on the command line and prints a
sequence of numbers where each is the product of the original sequence
except for the number at that position, i.e, output i is the product
of all the original numbers except for the ith one.

With no arguments, its input defaults to the sequence 2,4,3,5.

The main routine getSpecialProducts(int a[], int n).

      // Input: a vector of integers.
      // Output: a vector array s where each
      // entry contains the product of all numbers other than the number at
      // that index.

See the makefile for further details.
